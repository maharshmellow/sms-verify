# SMS-Verify

#### Things to know
```diff
- put the country code and the area code for it to work properly (ex: `1XXXXXXX` for a Canadian / US number) 
- the SMS API has a limit of 100 messages per month so it will not work if the limit has been reached
- since the app is running on a free heroku dyno, it may take time to start up initially
```
