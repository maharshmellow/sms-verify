#### Things to know
```diff
- put the country code and the area code for it to work properly (ex: `1XXXXXXX` for a Canadian / US number) 
- the SMS API has a limit of 100 messages per month so it will not work if the limit has been reached
- since the app is running on a limited VPS with many other apps, it may be slow
```
